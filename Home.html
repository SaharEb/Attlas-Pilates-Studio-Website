			<h1>Pilates: How does it work?</h1>
			<p>Pilates uses a combination of approximately 50 simple,
			repetitive exercises to create muscular exertion.
			Advocates of this system of exercise claim that exercises
			can be adapted to provide either gentle strength training 
			for rehabilitation or a strenuous workout vigorous enough
			to challenge skilled athletes. The exercises are designed 
			to increase muscle strength and endurance, as well as
			flexibility and to improve posture and balance.
			</p>
